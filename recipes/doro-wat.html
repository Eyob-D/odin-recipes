      <li>10 cloves garlic minced</li>
      <li>3 inches ginger minced (~50 g)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>
        6 medium red onions minced or finely chopped (about 6 cups, or 900
        grams)
      </li>
      <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
      <li>1/2 cup berbere</li>
      <li>2 cups water (approximate)</li>
      <li>1/3 cup niter kibbeh</li>
      <li>1 tsp korarima or green cardamom seeds</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt or to taste</li>
      <li>6 hard-boiled eggs peeled and</li>
      <li>injera</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine ginger, garlic, and oil to make paste. Set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Place a large dutch oven (or similar pot) over low heat on the stove
        top. Add the minced onions to the dry pan and cook slowly, stirring
        regularly as the liquid releases and allows the onions to simmer and
        caramelize. If necessary, you can add a little oil. Cook until the
        onions are caramelized and fragrant - generally around 25-30 minutes.
        (Note: don't try rush this step, as it's key to the flavour of the
        finished dish!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the ginger/garlic paste and tomato paste to the pot. Saute for 2-3
        minutes, stirring regularly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the berbere and stir to combine, then saute for about 1 minute. Add
        2 cups of water. Increase the heat to medium and and bring the pot to a
        low simmer for about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the niter kibbeh and spices and stir to combine. Simmer for 5 more
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until the chicken
        is very tender - around 1 hour. If the sauce starts to thicken and
        sputter a bit too much while cooking, you can add a little extra water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the hard boiled eggs, and continue to simmer gently for about 10
        more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want a thinner/soupier sauce, you can add a little bit of water.
        Adjust salt to taste if necessary. Serve with injera and plenty of extra
        sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
