    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Birria tacos are so delicious and this recipe is my take on the world's
      most trendy taco.
   A super savory, aromatic consommé is served on the side for dipping.</p>
   <br><br> 
   <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        3 tablespoons reserved beef fat from beef birria recipe, or more as
        needed
      </li>
      <li>8 (5 inch) corn tortillas</li>
      <li>2 cups freshly grated Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded Beef Birria</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons chopped white onion, or to taste, divided</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste, divided</li>
      <li>1 medium lime, cut into 4 wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the consommé: Stir beef birria sauce, chicken broth, carrots,
        celery, and cabbage together in a saucepan over high heat. Bring to a
        simmer, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, occasionally
        brushing the caramelized bits (fond) off the side with the hot liquid,
        until vegetables are nice and tender and consommé has reached the
        desired consistency, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and keep
        hot while you prepare the tacos.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the tacos: Heat some reserved beef fat in a large skillet over
        medium heat until melted. Add two tortillas and flip with a spatula
        until generously coated in fat. Toast briefly until golden brown, then
        cover with Monterey Jack cheese and some shredded beef. Drizzle each
        taco with about 1 tablespoon consommé liquid, then top with some white
        onion and cilantro.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold tacos in half and press gently. Continue to cook, flipping back and
        forth, until browned and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and
        repeat to make remaining tacos, adding more fat if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle consommé into a bowl and garnish with any remaining white onion
        and cilantro. Squeeze lime wedges into consommé and serve with tacos.
      </li>
